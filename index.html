   <h2><b>Journey to becoming a Software Developer</b></h2> 
</div>

<p>First of all, I think this is coolest profession out there. I believe there is <b>job security</b> in this field. I joined Coding Temple because of the repuatation this bootcamp has. One of the main reasons I wanted to go to the bootcamp route was because I know I would get all the resources and structure I need to be sucessful. My main goal is to become a <i>Blockchain Developer</i>. Also, the flexibility and all the opprutunities that comes in the space! It is a big transition for me coming from the construction side ,but I am ready to take on all the challenges I run into on my journey. </p>
